## API Integration
This project relies on the following APIs for currency information and exchange rates:



1- [Currencies Info API](https://bmgraduationproject-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/currencies-info/currencies) - Retrieve a list of supported currencies.

2- [Exchange Rate API](https://bmgraduationproject-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/exchange-rate/currency-exchangeRate/USD) - Fetch real-time exchange rates.

To integrate these APIs, you might need to sign up, obtain API keys, and configure them in your project.
